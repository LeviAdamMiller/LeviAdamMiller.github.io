<h1>About Me! - First off my name is Levi!</h1>

<p>Hi, my name is Levi, im taking this class to gain more experience with front end web development.
    My long term goal is to be a working software developer. Before I ever took any programming classes I always
    loved technology. It had allowed me to learn skills that I wanted to learn, it made things so convenient. I
    saw the good technology does for people, it truly improves peoples day to day life. As I have gone down this
    path of learning software development, it has only reaffirmed my appreciation for what software can do and how
    complex it actually is. I also think computers are just cool, all the hardware is interesting to me. I like
    seeing all the new hardware coming out year after year getting faster and faster. </p>

<p> I have 2 Dogs, Max is a chihuahua mix he is 10 years old. Winston is a yorkie jack russel terrier mutt,
    and he is 3 years old. I am originally from Yakima Washington, but I also lived in Tri-cities Washington for
    many years and then in July 2020 I moved to Seattle. I went to Columbia Basin College from 2018 to 2021,then
    I went to Seattle Central College for a quarter in 2021, now I go to Green River. I have taken a couple of
    java classes, one python class, a database systems class and most recently took SDEV 106. I am semi confident
    about my HTML and CSS skills, always room for improvement.</p>

<p>I think the thing i most struggle with in HTML is spacing, I feel like I can style things well and set up
    lists and get images on the page. I try my best to get my element where I want them, but I could definitely
    improve in that area. I like CSS styles because its very creative, I love picking out all the colors and fonts
    giving things shadows, and curved edges. I'm excited to learn more JavaScript, I want to make my pages more
    interactive
    and fun to use.</p>

<p>In my free time I love to paint, watercolor paint is what I mostly use, but I do sometimes use acrylic paint.
    I also play guitar and sometimes an acoustic bass. I also have been getting more into video games, I was never
    really a gamer, but I love the nintendo switch. I have played Splatoon, Mario Odyssey, Kirby and the forgotten land,
    Luigi's haunted mansion 2, and of course the classics like Super Smash Bros and Mario Kart.
